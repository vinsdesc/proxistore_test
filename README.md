Proxistore exercise
As frontend developer/designer, you should be able to create HTML/CSS pages and integrate some dynamic data thanks to Javascript. As an exercise we ask to reinvent two pages which exist in our application:

Campaign listing,
Campaign details.
The exercise is quite open and feel free to go as further as you can/want. We develop some mock endpoints in order to dynamize your pages.

Feel free to use anything you want:

Framework: VueJs, React, Angular or VanillaJS
CSS Framework or preprocessors: Sass, bootstrap, tailwind
Docker based, codepen, heroku, whatever.
!!! For submission, create a pull request on this repository !!!
